I’m Kennedy Kambi — an Electronic and Computer Engineering graduate from Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT), passionate about building practical, real-world technology solutions. My work spans embedded systems, IoT, frontend development, open-data projects, and hands-on engineering prototypes. I enjoy taking ideas from concept to working systems, whether that means writing firmware, designing a PCB, building a digital dashboard, or creating an entire web experience.

Over the years, I’ve worked on diverse engineering projects, from smart LPG metering systems and sensor-driven water monitoring dashboards to group projects like the Automatic Door Alert System (ADAS) and the Elevator Control System simulation, where I worked with microcontrollers, sensors, motors, GSM modules, and PCB fabrication. I’ve also developed several software projects, including interactive data visualizations, e-commerce websites, and AI-powered tools such as ClaudeChef and OSM Wrapped.

My internships and technical roles — at places like Public Works, Numeral IoT, Gearbox Academy, and The School Box — exposed me to electrical design, system testing, SMT assembly, documentation, troubleshooting, and real-world engineering workflows. These experiences taught me problem-solving, teamwork, and how to build solutions that are not only functional but meaningful.

Beyond hardware, I enjoy bringing ideas to life on the web. I build clean, responsive interfaces using React, JavaScript, and modern UI tools. I value design that feels intuitive, simple, and human-centered — whether it's an online store, a mapping tool, or a personal project.

I’m also an active contributor to OpenStreetMap, using open geospatial data to support humanitarian efforts, community development, and mapping for vulnerable regions.

At my core, I’m driven by curiosity, creativity, and the desire to learn something new every day. This blog is where I share the things I build, the ideas I explore, and the projects that shape my journey as an engineer and developer.
