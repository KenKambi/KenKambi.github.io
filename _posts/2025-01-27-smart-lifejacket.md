# Smart Lifejacket

Traditional life jackets are essential, but they lack the capability to provide real-time tracking and distress signaling—leading to challenges in rescue operations.

**Enter the Smart Life Jacket**, a next-generation solution that integrates **GPS**, **RFID**, **water sensors**, **panic buttons**, and **LoRa communication technology** to enhance emergency response and boost survival rates.

## 🚀 How It Works

✅ **Real-Time Location Tracking** via GPS & LoRa ensures fast pinpointing of distress signals—even in remote areas.  
✅ **Wearer Identification** with RFID aids coordinated rescues in large maritime operations.  
✅ **Automated Alerts & SOS** triggered by water sensors, panic buttons, and LED indicators enable swift responses.  
✅ **Web-Based Monitoring Platform** tracks wearer status and coordinates rescue efforts efficiently.

## 🌍 Applications

🌊 **Maritime Safety** for fishermen, offshore workers, and sailors.  
🚤 **Boating & Water Sports** for kayakers and jet-skiers.  
⛴ **Passenger Ferries & Cruise Ships** with RFID-based tracking.  
🛟 **Flood & Disaster Response** for faster rescue operations.


This life-saving technology goes beyond flotation, it enhances **rescue precision and speed**.

Let’s innovate for safety!
