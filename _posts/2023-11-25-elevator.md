**Elevator Control System** was a collaborative university project designed to simulate the logic and movement of an elevator using embedded hardware. The aim was to understand how user input, state tracking, and motor control interact in a real-world system.

Our group used an ESP32 microcontroller connected to three push buttons representing floors 1, 2, and 3. When a floor button was pressed, the ESP32 compared it with the current floor and directed a DC motor to spin clockwise (up) or anti-clockwise (down) to simulate elevator movement.

The full prototype was built on a breadboard with jumper wires, allowing quick adjustments as we refined the control logic. Despite its simplicity, the system effectively demonstrated how elevators process floor requests and manage movement direction.

This project deepened our understanding of embedded control systems, motor direction handling, and team-based problem-solving—bringing textbook elevator concepts to life in a hands-on way. ⬆️⬇️
