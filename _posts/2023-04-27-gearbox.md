My internship at **Gearbox Academy** was a hands-on engineering experience that allowed me to work closely with cross-functional teams to bring real IoT solutions to life. I contributed to the development of the **“Soma Tank”** project—an intelligent water-level monitoring system aimed at improving efficiency and transparency in water management.

Our team integrated an **ultrasonic sensor system** to accurately measure water levels inside storage tanks. I assisted in calibration, troubleshooting, and testing to ensure reliable real-world performance. The project also included developing a **web-based dashboard** for real-time visualization of tank data. By presenting key metrics clearly, the dashboard improved decision-making for stakeholders.

Working on Soma Tank taught me valuable lessons in sensor accuracy, data handling, system reliability, and cross-team collaboration. It also strengthened my passion for building practical IoT solutions that solve real problems in communities. From prototyping to testing, every stage offered a learning opportunity and a deeper appreciation for engineering as a tool for impact.
