**ADAS (Automatic Door Alarm System)** was a group hardware project focused on building a motion-activated door alert system using sensing, PCB design, and visual feedback. The goal was to combine practical PCB fabrication skills with an IoT-driven security solution.

Our team used a PIR sensor to detect motion near a door, triggering an ESP32 microcontroller that powered the system’s logic. A simple LED provided instant visual feedback to the user—making the system ideal for basic home or office monitoring.

One of the most hands-on parts of the project was the PCB development process. Using KiCad, we designed the board layout, transferred the pattern onto a copper plate using an iron, etched it chemically, drilled holes, and manually soldered the components. A buck converter ensured safe, regulated power delivery.

ADAS strengthened our teamwork and exposed us to the complete workflow of designing, fabricating, and assembling a functional electronic system—turning theory into a practical engineering experience. ⚡
