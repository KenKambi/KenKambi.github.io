[**OSM Wrapped**](https://osmwrapped.com)is a web application that visualizes and celebrates key overall and annual contributions of OpenStreetMap (OSM) members📆. 

Using **React**, the interface is designed to be responsive and data-driven highlighting each user’s journey in mapping. Enter your OSM username to generate a personalized summary including mapping streaks, most active month, countries contributed to, and other achievements📊.

To make it shareable and meaningful, OSM Wrapped includes:
- **Heatmaps** showing geographic footprints of a user’s edits  
- **Downloadable summary pages**, so users can save or share their OSM achievements  
- **Video-like slideshows**, transitioning through contributions, highlights, and a final summary  

This project represents my passion for blending **tech, community, and storytelling**—using code not just to show data, but to make contributors feel seen and appreciated. It’s also a foundation for future updates like global leaderboards, and enhanced visual analytics💯.
