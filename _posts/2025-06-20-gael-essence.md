[**Gael Essence**](https://kenkambi.github.io/gael/) is a digital concept I built to explore the intersection of scent, user experience, and modern web technology. The idea behind it was simple: how can I create a seamless, elegant online experience that captures the essence of perfume shopping, while integrating familiar tools like WhatsApp for easy communication?

Built using **React**, the interface is clean, responsive, and optimized for mobile use. I focused on creating a minimalist but immersive product showcase, where users can explore fragrance collections with visual cues and short descriptions. To simplify customer interaction, I integrated a WhatsApp chat feature—allowing users to make inquiries or place orders directly through the messaging platform.

This project reflects my interest in combining storytelling, aesthetics, and tech to create digital experiences that feel personal and functional. It’s also a foundation for future ecommerce and fragrance-focused projects I hope to grow.
