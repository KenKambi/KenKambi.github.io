During my Research & Development internship at **Numeral IOT**, I had the opportunity to work in a fast-paced hardware engineering environment where ideas move quickly from concept to prototype. This experience strengthened my hands-on skills in electronics, embedded systems, and product development—core areas that shaped how I approach engineering today.

One of my key responsibilities was assisting in operating **Surface Mount Technology (SMT) machines** to assemble Simba Speed Governor PCBs. Our team achieved a 95% component placement accuracy across more than 1,200 units, giving me practical exposure to manufacturing workflows, precision assembly, and quality checks.  

Another highlight was contributing to the development of a **smart LPG metering system** designed to monitor gas levels, detect tampering, and send alerts. I supported the team in sensor integration, circuit testing, data acquisition, and troubleshooting during prototyping. 

This internship gave me deep insight into how engineering teams design, document, test, and iterate on real products. It strengthened my debugging skills, improved my attention to detail, and showed me how innovation and teamwork come together to build impactful solutions in the IoT space.
