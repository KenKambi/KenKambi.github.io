[**Claude Chef** ](https://myclaudechef.netlify.app/)  is an **AI** recipe generator built using **React** and **OpenRouter**, powered by **Deepseek**/**Open-AI** model(s). The idea is simple but powerful: users input a few ingredients they have on hand, and the app returns a detailed, creative recipe they can cook on the spot🍲.

It is deployed using **Netlify**, integrating **serverless functions** to handle API requests securely from the frontend. The result is a smooth, fast user experience with minimal backend overhead🍳.

Claude Chef's idea is a fun way to experiment with real-time AI generation, clean UI components, and modern deployment practices. It also reflects how artificial intelligence can be applied in everyday tasks like meal planning, making the kitchen a more inspired place🍽️.
